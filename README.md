# chessagon

Chessagon, chess again.

(just an implementation of [hexagonal chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess#Gli%C5%84ski's_hexagonal_chess) ^^).

## Installation

If you just want to play chessagon, this project provides a nice little native ui for that. There are various options to use it:

- https://chessagon.odilf.com (online WASM build)
- Install with `cargo install chessagon`
- Use the provided flake: `nix run github:odilf/chessagon`

The user interface should be intuitive. Have fun!

## As a library

You can use the `chessagon` library in Rust to build games, uis, engines or whatever you want! The main documentation should be available at https://docs.rs/chessagon.
