//! Hexagonal coordinates.
//!
//! Coordinates in hexagons are a bit tricky. Using cartesian coordinates is really not practical,
//! so generally we would like to use a different basis. The problem is that there is no useful
//! perpendicual basis, and hexagons always have this 3-way symmetry, given that you have neighbors
//! in 3 distinct directions (each direction has two neighbors, so total of 6 neighbors). This
//! makes it fundamentally impossible to have a completely analogous system to regular cartesian
//! coordinates.
//!
//! So, how can we describe the neighbors? Instead of being at directions `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`, they
//! should be at `(0,1)`, `(1,0)` and `(1,1)`. From the center hexagon, each should be one of the
//! neighbours. Technically you can choose any combination, but the most reasonable is probably
//! to say that `(1,0)` is the left one, `(1,1)` is the center, and `(0,1)` the right.
//!
//! There is an other alternative to this system. You see that `(1,1)` is straight vertical. So...
//! why not make that `(0,1)`? and then find the straight horizontal, which turns out to be `(1,-1)` and make that `(1,0)`.
//! This sounds nice because it's easier to think about, but the problem then is that the two
//! neighbors are at `1/âˆš2` distances, which are very annoying. TODO: Is this necessarly true?
